# The OFFICIAL STOS Basic Source Code Repository
Welcome to the official STOS Basic source code repository. On 27th June 2024, Francois Lionet passed the usage rights of STOS Basic and the STOS Compiler source code to Neil Halliday and the STOS Coders Facebook group to look after and maintain going forward. As custodians of Francois' STOS legacy, we aim to make sure this source code is up to date and available for everyone to enjoy.
